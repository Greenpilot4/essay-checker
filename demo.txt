Merriment, gaiety, amazing helps me recollect the memories that I have a summer vacation. In this story I am going to tell you about my marvelous journey to Colorado when we went skiing, the hugest mall I ever seen and to Cripple Creek.First, when we got to Colorado we rested at a hotel because we were driving for six hours and we only stop two times to stretch. The next morning when we woke up, we drove to springs, Colorado and went skiing. The snow was about three feet deep with a lot of footprints everywhere. It took me a really, really long time for me to keep my balance on the snowboard, but I have to admit that I fell many times but it was actually funny. It was getting dark sowe went to a new hotel took showers and went to a fancy restaurant and we walked in a they built an aquarium all over the restaurant.If you sat be the window you were sitting next to colorful fish. After we were done eating, we went to the hotel. We swam for a while and then went to sleep.We woke up the next morning and went to the Pueblo mall.  It was one of the hugest malls I have ever seen. We spent like an hour trying to find a parkingspot but we eventually found one. We went inside the mall ant started shopping. After we were done with that, my family, I went into thisminiature golf club, and everything was glow in the dark. I tumbled a coupleof time but it was funny. We spent like one hour and some minutes in thegulf club. So all together, we spent seven hours in the mall because therewere so much people.The third thing we did the next day was we took a trip to Cripple, Creek. Wearrived fourhours later. While my parents were gambling, my brothers and Iwent to the arcade it was really fun but I was also scare because there was many people there. Now I have told you all about my wonderful trip and my traveling so why wonâ€™t you go start planning yours.
